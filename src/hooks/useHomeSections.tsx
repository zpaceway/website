          This good boy was born in Ecuador ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¨ in 1995. Since a joung kiddo I
          was a fan of computers and technology. I started programming back in
          school in Visual Basic and I simply feel in love with coding. In the
          university my passion for technology lead me to study Mechatronics
          Engineering in{" "}

            Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas
          </span>{" "}
          in Ecuador. While studying I had the chance of working part time as a
          developer. Time passed, I published a paper, became the number one
          student in my career, getting the best graduated honor of the 2019
          promotion and right after that I started working professionally as a
          software engineer.
